# Latent Force Models for Soil Moisture Modelling

- ***LFM.py*** contains the latent force multi-ouput GP class, with the kernel corresponding to a convolution between a GP with rbf kernel and a Greens function of a 1st order ODE as described in [√Ålvarez et al.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/alvarez09a/alvarez09a.pdf)
- ***LFM_SoilMoisture.ipynb*** contains the experiments of modelling soil moisture data with LFMs
